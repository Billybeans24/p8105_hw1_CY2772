Problem1

``` r
# Load the penguins dataset
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
# Assign number of rows and columns for inline reporting
n_rows = nrow(penguins)
n_cols = ncol(penguins)
mean_flipper_length = mean(penguins$flipper_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE)
```

Description of the Dataset:

The penguins dataset contains 344 rows and 8 columns. It includes data
on various characteristics of penguins, such as their species, island,
bill length, bill depth, flipper length, body mass, and sex.

One important variable, species, includes three values: “Adelie”,
“Chinstrap”, and “Gentoo”. Another variable of interest is
flipper_length_mm, which measures the penguin’s flipper length in
millimeters. The mean flipper length across all penguins in the dataset
is 200.92 mm.

``` r
library(ggplot2)

# Scatterplot of flipper length vs bill length
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    title = "Scatterplot of Flipper Length vs Bill Length",
    x = "Bill Length (mm)",
    y = "Flipper Length (mm)",
    color = "Species"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```
