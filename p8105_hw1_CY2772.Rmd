# Description of the dataset
The `penguins` dataset contains 344 rows and 8 columns. It includes data on various characteristics of penguins, such as their species, island, bill length, bill depth, flipper length, body mass, and sex. 

One important variable, `species`, includes three values: "Adelie", "Chinstrap", and "Gentoo". Another variable of interest is `flipper_length_mm`, which measures the penguin's flipper length in millimeters. The mean flipper length across all penguins in the dataset is 200.92 mm.
